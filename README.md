# Sentiment
A new way of viewing sentimental memories in AR


## Tracking Approach

We are using the marker approach highlighted in the [arjs blog post](https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/). This approach allows us to define a marker and place elements on top of it. To test simply print out this image ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg) and then use AR to look at it.


This is however unreliable for dozens of reasons like light conditions, quality of print etc.

## Alternatives

We could alternatively use [location-based tracking](https://aframe.io/blog/arjs3/#location-based-ar), this is much more reliable.
